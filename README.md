# Random-Image-Generator

This is my second project made with only tkinter python, its not much i made it in a month, simple explained what it does:
this project displays random image by an url from unsplash.com, which you can download,
and that image is going to be saved in folder named "images downloaded" in 1920x1080 resolution.

I was having a different idea for this project, but i made this one because i wanted to finish one qui in a month.
This project is for everyone who likes exploring cool images.

To Run this Application you just need python installed on your computer.

The way this qui app works is:
by clicking enter, python goes to this link "https://picsum.photos//1920/1080",
converts it to an image and displays it on a label, when pressing enter multiple times, the label will be updated with another image.

Feel free to download.
